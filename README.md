## Project Title

Todo Application

## Description

This project is a Todo application that utilizes Valkey for backend storage and Nginx as a reverse proxy. It is built using Go and Docker to provide a simple and efficient way to manage todos.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **Valkey**: A lightweight key-value store for backend storage.
- **Nginx**: Acts as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests.
- **Docker**: For containerization of the application and its dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-valkey-go.git
   cd todo-valkey-go
   ```
2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
3. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage

- Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`
- Use the following endpoints:
  - `GET /listKeys`: Retrieve all keys in the Valkey database.
  - `POST /addItem`: Add a new todo item (JSON body required).
  - `GET /getItem?uuid=<UUID>`: Retrieve a specific todo item by its UUID.
